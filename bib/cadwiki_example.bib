abstract = {This paper presents an overview of two loss mechanisms in multi-path passive mixers: 1) the up-conversion of harmonic images due to the square shape of the LO sampling pulses, and 2) the overlap between LO pulses. Both these mechanisms can be modeled by a shunting impedance on the mixer input and we explore two methods to mitigate their effects. We expanded a passive-mixer first receiver to N{\textgreater};8 phases and characterized gain, noise and input impedance tuning range. Additionally, we included hardware to directly measure the effect of overlapping LO pulses on the gain and input impedance of these receivers. Finally, we propose a method to use integrated inductors to suppress the currents which flow when two mixer switches are on at the same time, alleviating this loss mechanism.},

@article{Andrews2010a,
abstract = {A software-defined radio (SDR) receiver with baseband programmable RF bandpass filter (BPF) and complex impedance match is presented. The passive mixer-first architecture used here allows the impedance characteristics of the receiver's baseband circuits to be translated to the RF port of the receiver. Tuning the resistance at the baseband port allows for a real impedance match to the antenna. The addition of "complex feedback" between I and Q paths allows for matching to the imaginary component of the antenna impedance. By implementing both real and imaginary components with resistors in feedback around low noise baseband amplifiers, noise figure is also kept low. Tunable sampling capacitors on the baseband side of the passive mixer translate to tunable-Q filters on the RF port which allow for very good out-of-band linearity. Furthermore, the concept of in-band and out-of-band must be redefined as the impedance match and BPF center frequency move with the LO frequency, such that matching and filtering track the receive frequency. Additionally, 8-phase mixing is shown to provide significant benefits such as impedance matching range, rejection of blockers at LO harmonics, and lower noise figure (NF). Measurements from the receiver implemented in 65 nm CMOS show 70 dB of gain, NF as low as 3 dB, and 25 dBm out-of-band IIP3. Furthermore, tunable impedance matching shows that S11 {\&}lt;;- 30 dB can be achieved at any receive frequency from 0.1-1.3 GHz.},

abstract = {The analysis of a mixer-first receiver using conversion matrices is presented. Conversion matrices provide a systematic approach to analyze linear periodically time-varying (LPTV) circuits. Using conversion matrices of LPTV components in a frequency domain equivalent circuit allows analysis similar to a linear time invariant (LTI) circuit. For example, Ohm's law, Kirchhoff's voltage and current laws, impedance combination rules, etc., can all be used in such equivalent circuits. On applying this method to a mixer-first receiver, a common LPTV circuit, results already established in prior art are reproduced accurately. Further, effects of a few important non-idealities, such as clock overlaps, imperfect clock edges and parasitic components that were not considered previously, are also calculated and verified.},
